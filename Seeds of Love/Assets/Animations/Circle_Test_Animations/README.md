**REMINDER:** A VIDEO/VISUAL GUIDE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WRITTEN GUIDES

This is general guidelines and reminders when creating animations. This is by no means the only way to create animations
There are tons of other methods, this Circle_Test_Animation just Serves as a example. It is also a static animation, 
so it will be in the same spot every time. :(

## Creating a animation for a Sprite Object

1. Create the sprite object
2. Go to Window -> Animation -> Animation to open the Animation window 
3. Select the object to be animated, the Animator window should have the option to create an animation. Select that.
4. Now to create Key frames. Press the "Record" button (Looks like a red button)
5. Move object to initial position, press the Keyframe button (Looks like a + and a diamond)
6. After creating the first Keyframe, you should see diamonds appear in the animator track. That is your first Keyframe
7. Move the line on top of the first Keyframe to right to mark where your next Keyframe will be (Further you go, slower the animation)
8. Alter the object (move or scale) and press the Keyframe button again to create the next Keyframe. Unity will smooth the transitions between Keyframes
9. Repeat 7-8 as much as you like.
10. Follow these ten commandments, and you will be a basic animator.
