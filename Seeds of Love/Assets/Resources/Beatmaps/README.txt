hi it me hana
so some notes on writing beatmaps (if anyone else ends up making one):
-assume bpm is 3 digits, for values less than 3 digits lead with 0s

-assume measures are 3 digits, also lead with 0s if needed

-assume beats are 2 digits, also lead with 0s if needed

-subdivisions is number of times beat is divided (for example like if
 subdivisions = 2, 1 beat in terms of the beatmap is an eighth note)

-lanes are numbered, from left to right: 1, 2, 3, 4

-note types are: a - pressing the key
                 b - just being on the lane
                 1 - beginning of a hold note
                 2 - end of a hold note

-measure:beat is when the note occurs musically and when the player should
 hit it, while converted timing is when it should spawn in the game

-functionally, white space doesn't matter, but for the sake of readability
 indent each lane with 3 tabs (assuming a tab = 4 spaces)

-functionally, bottom of time signature does nothing bc i dont want to deal
 with that. its mostly just a formality right now so please dont make any
 like super complex tracks in like 7/8 or 19/16 please. for the love of god.
