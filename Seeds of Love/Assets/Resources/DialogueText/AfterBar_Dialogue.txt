Sunny;I guess I just got a little frustrated because she’s usually such a sweetheart, and all but...;11;R
Sunny;Oh, um, I’m rambling, aren't I? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to.;11;R
Maria;No-no, it’s okay!;0;L
Sunny;Look at me, dumping all my problems on someone I just met. Sorry again.;11;R
Maria;Seriously, it’s okay! I don’t mind at all. It was obvious you needed someone to talk to.;0;L
Sunny;...;6;R
Maria;And you shouldn’t have to deal with all that on your own.;6;L
Sunny;... Thank you.;0;R
Maria;Besides, it was fun getting to know you. I don't think I've ever really talked to anyone like this before.;2;L
Sunny;...;9;R
Maria;(So cheesy... but it's the truth.);2;L
Sunny;Um, this is a bit random, but...;0;R
Maria;Yeah?;0;L
Sunny;What time is it?;3;R
Maria;Oh. Uh, around midnight.;0;L
Sunny;That’s... actually pretty late. I should head home now.;3;R
Maria;Oh, sorry for keeping you so long!;0;L
Sunny;I would stay longer! If I could. I’ve stayed longer tonight than I ever have before.;0;R
Sunny;And, about what you said...;0;R
Sunny;I’ve, um, never been able to talk to someone like this before either.;9;R
Maria;Oh?!;5;L
Sunny;But I really should be going!;6;R
Maria;Yes! Got, um, class tomorrow?;2;L
Sunny;Pfft..! It’s Friday, María. Well, Saturday now.;1;R
Maria;Oh, right!;5;L
Sunny;But seriously, thank you for talking to me tonight. I'm too shy to go up to people, so I usually sit alone.;0;R
Sunny;This was really nice.;1;R
