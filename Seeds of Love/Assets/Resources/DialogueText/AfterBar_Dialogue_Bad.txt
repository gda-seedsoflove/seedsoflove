Maria;... and the atmosphere was so suffocating, I felt like I would go crazy if I stayed there any longer. I just didn't belong there.;6;L
Sunny;Mhmm...;6;R
Maria;Ugh... Sorry, at this point, I’m just whining to you like a baby...;6;L
Sunny;Oh no, it’s fine! I’m sorry you've had such a tough time.;6;R
Sunny;Funny you say that you don’t belong... I understand that feeling.;5;R
Sunny;I’ve lived in the same place all my life. I haven't seen anything new in years.;5;R
Sunny;I’m not sure when, but after a while, I just felt like... I didn’t belong anymore.;11;R
Maria;Really? Can't you just... leave?;0;L
Sunny;Well... not really. My whole life is here, and I can’t really abandon it.;11;R
Maria;(Not the way I did, I guess.);6;L
Sunny;My family, my friends, my students... I can’t just leave them all behind.;11;R
Maria;Oh, I see. Who knew being an adult was so hard...;6;L
Maria;I wish I was better at it. I'm not as strong as you, Sunny.;0;L
Sunny;I'm not so sure about that.;2;R
Sunny;But don't worry, you'll still have plenty of time to figure things out!;0;R
Sunny;That's why you're here, aren't you?;1;R
Maria;...;0;L
Sunny;I can tell you're a good person, María. I'm not usually the kind of person to go up to strangers, but I felt comfortable talking to you.;0;R
Sunny;Sometimes I feel like a real nuisance...;5;R
Maria;O-of course you're not!;6;L
Sunny;Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -;3;R
Maria;You're really not! You listened to me blabber on and on about my problems tonight...;0;L
Maria;And if you need someone to talk to, I can be there to listen.;1;L
Sunny;...I guess we listened to each other’s problems plenty tonight.;1;R
Maria;And we don't just have to talk about our problems! We can also -;2;L
Maria;!;13;L
Sunny;Is something wrong?;6;R
Maria;Oh, I uh, just realized it's midnight...;3;L
Maria;I told my grandma I wouldn't be out too long. Farmers have to get up early, and all that...;4;L
Sunny;Oh! That's... actually pretty late.;3;R
Sunny;I don't usually stay out this long.;3;R
Maria;But hey, before we go, I just want to say thanks for talking with someone as lame as me.;2;L
Sunny;Don’t say that! ...I think you’re really cool.;9;R
Maria;(!!!);5;L
Maria;Nice - nice talking with you though! See you around?;2;L
Sunny;Absolutely. If you ever want to chat, I would love to meet up again.;1;R
Maria;That would be amazing...;5;L
Maria;Okay, I really have to go now. Good night, Sunny! I’ll be sure to -;2;L
Maria;ACK!;13;L
##;Sunny;exit
Barnabus;The door.;0;R
Maria;Haha, I meant to do that...;2;L
##;Barnabus;exit
Sunny;Pfft.;1;R
Sunny;Bye, María.;1;R

Sunny;Huh...;0;R
Sunny;Hey Barnabus, how do you feel about Maria?;0;R

Sunny;Good to know.;0;R
