Maria;... and the atmosphere was so suffocating, I felt like I would go crazy if I stayed there any longer. I just didn't belong there ;0;L
Maria;Ugh... At this point, I’m just whining like a baby...;0;L
Sunny;Oh no, it’s fine! I’m sorry you've had such a tough time.;2;R
Sunny;Funny you say that you don’t belong... I understand that feeling.;2;R
Sunny;I’ve lived in the same place all my life. I haven't seen anything new in years.;0;R
Sunny;I’m not sure when, but after a while, I just felt like... I didn’t belong anymore.;2;R
Maria;Really? Can't you just... leave?;0;L
Sunny;Well... not really. My whole life is here, and I can’t really abandon it.;0;R
Maria;(Not the way I did, I guess.);0;L
Sunny;My family, my friends, my students... I can’t just leave them all behind.;2;R
Maria;Students? You're a teacher?;0;L
Sunny;Well, student teacher.;2;R
Maria;Oh, I see. Who knew being an adult was so hard...;0;L
Maria;I wish I was better at it. I'm not as strong as you, Sunny.;0;L
Sunny;I'm not so sure about that.;2;R
Sunny;B-but anyway! Don't worry, you'll still have plenty of time to figure things out!;0;R
Sunny;That's why you're here, aren't you?;2;R
Maria;...;0;R
Sunny;You're a good person, Maria. I'm not usually the kind of person to go up to strangers, but I felt comfortable talking to you.;0;R
Sunny;Sometimes I feel like I'm a real nuisance...;0;R
Maria;O-of course you're not!;0;L
Sunny;Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -;0;R
Maria;You're really not! You listened to me blabber on and on about my problems tonight...;0;L
Maria;And if you need someone to talk to, I can be there to listen.;0;L
Sunny;...I guess we listened to each other’s problems plenty tonight.;0;R
Maria;And we don't just have to talk about our problems! We can also -;0;L
Maria;!;0;L
Sunny;Is something wrong?;0;R
Maria;Oh, I uh, just realized it's midnight...;0;L
Maria;I told my grandma I wouldn't be out too long. Farmers have to get up early, and all that...;0;L
Sunny;Oh! That's... actually pretty late.;0;R
Sunny;I don't usually stay out this long.;0;R
Maria;Hey, thanks for talking with someone as lame as me.;0;L
Sunny;Don’t say that! ...I think you’re really cool.;0;R
Maria;(!!!);0;L
Maria;Nice - nice talking with you though! See you around?;0;L
Sunny;Absolutely. If you ever want to chat, I would love to meet up again.;0;R
Maria;Bye Sunny! I’ll be sure to -;0;L
Maria:ACK!;0;L
##;Sunny;exit
Barnabus;The door.;0;R
Maria;Haha, I meant to do that...;0;L
