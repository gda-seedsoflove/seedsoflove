Maria;(Oh, she actually liked it!);0;L
Sunny;I'm Sunny, if you're wondering.;1;R
Maria;Hi, I'm Maria.;1;L
Maria;So... is it normal for a girl as pretty as you to be sitting alone?;0;L
Sunny;Oh, uhh... well, I, uhh...;5;R
Sunny;I mean, I just got off of work...;0;R
Sunny;And I saw that the bar was open...;0;R
Sunny;So I came in...;0;R
Sunny;Cause I like drinking here...;0;R
Sunny;I just do the occasional social drinking...;2;R
Sunny;Alone...;5;R
Sunny;...;5;R
Sunny;But anyways, what brings you here? Why talk to someone like me?;9;R
Maria;Oh, you know... I just got off working on a farm.;0;L
Sunny;A farm?;3;R
Maria;Yeah! With all the tools, and the dirt..., and carrots...;0;L
Sunny;Wow, so you’re a farmer...;0;R
Maria;Sort of. I'm helping out at my abuela’s farm.;0;L
Sunny;Abuela?;3;R
Maria;Grandma.;0;L
Sunny;Oh, right. Say, your grandma wouldn’t happen to be Rosa, would she?;0;R
Maria;You know her? I didn't realize she was that famous.;0;L
Sunny;Well, we don't actually have that many farms out here.;0;R
Sunny;Not small ones, at least.;0;R
Maria;Wow, I didn't know that. I just think she's amazing.;1;L
Maria;I came out here to learn... something from her.;6;L
Sunny;Ahh, I knew I’ve never seen you around before. You're the first new person I've seen in a while.;1;R
Maria;Really?;0;L
Sunny;I'm used to seeing people leave, but I get really excited whenever someone new comes in. Everything is so samey.;6;R
Maria;What? But it's so amazing here! Everything seems so different, and new, and there’s like sheep everywhere.;2;L
Maria;Well, probably. I still haven't seen any sheep.;6;L
Sunny;I guess you’ve been having a good time then. Have you been around town?;1;R
Maria;Not much yet... But I think I’m going to really like it here.;1;L
Sunny;Really? Why do you say that?;0;R
Maria;Oh, I’m from the bay. It’s like big and bustling and busy, but once you’ve tried everything, it feels so empty.;0;L
Maria;I was going to college in the city, 'cause that was just what you do after high school, but now that I’m almost done, I just... didn’t feel right there.;6;L
Maria;I had a moment where I was like, “What am I doing?” So I decided to come here to figure that out.;0;L
Sunny;You gave up city life for... this?;6;R
Maria;I didn’t exactly give it up, just decided to take a break.;0;L
Sunny;Huh... Well, I hope you get something good out of this little town.;1;R
Maria;...Yeah, I hope so too.;2;L
Maria;So, uhhhh that's enough about me. What’s your story?;1;L
Sunny;Huh? You wanna hear about me?;3;R
Maria;Well, yeah! I came here to get away from all the stuff back home. You seem like a perfect getaway.;2;L
Maria;(That didn’t come out right...);5;L
Sunny;Well, I mean, I don’t have much to say. I’ve lived here all my life. It's been pretty normal...;9;R
Sunny;I honestly don’t know what else there is to know.;0;R
Maria;Alright then, let me ask the questions.;0;L
