Maria;(Well, I guess this place seems okay...);0;L
Bartender;Here for a drink?;0;R
Maria;(!!!);3;L
Maria;No! I mean, yes! I... I... yeah.;4;L
Bartender;After what I saw on the farm, I think you need one.;0;R
Maria;You saw what happened?;3;L
Bartender;Mhmm...;0;R
Maria;(Oh no, why does Barnabus have to be the bartender too?);4;L
Barnabus;Look.;0;R
Barnabus;Working on a farm is hard, and no one is going to be perfect at it on their first day.;0;R
Barnabus;It’s going to be tiring, and everything is going to hurt, and you’ll be washing dirt out of places you never think dirt could be.;0;R
Barnabus;But if you're really cut out for it, one day you’re going to wake up and know that it's the good life.;0;R
Maria;Really?;6;L
Barnabus;Mhmm.;0;R
Maria;O-okay. Thanks.;6;L
Maria;(Wow, that was really nice of him to say that.);0;L

Sunny;Long day?;6;R
Maria;Uhh... yeah... something like that.;0;L
Sunny;Yeah. It gets like that around here.;0;R
Maria;You too then?;0;L
Sunny;Yeah, I guess... ;5;R
Maria;I feel that. Farming apparently isn’t something I'm cut out for.;0;L
Sunny;Yeah, it’s harder than it looks.;6;R
Maria;Tell me about it.;0;L
Sunny;You're a farmer?;0;R
Maria;Well, trying to be at least.;6;L
Sunny;...;0;R
Sunny;My name is Sunny, by the way.;0;R
Maria;Oh, María. Nice to meet you.;0;L
Sunny;So, first time in a bar?;0;R
Maria;Yeah, how’d you figure?;0;L
Sunny;Well, I saw you choking on a bourbon, so I assumed you don’t drink much.;2;R
Maria;Oh, you saw that?;2;L
Maria;(FUCK, she saw that…);4;L
Sunny;Yeah, but it’s okay. Everyone has a first time.;1;R
Sunny;What brings you to the Golden Sheep?;0;R
Maria;Well, I made a mess at my abuela's farm, so I guessed this would be a good place to crash for a bit while I regret my life choices.;0;L
Sunny;Abuela?;3;R
Maria;Grandma.;0;L
Sunny;Oh! That’s good to know.;0;R
Maria;My grandma's amazing, but I never knew she did so much work. She made it look so effortless.;6;L
Sunny;Really, how so?;0;R
Maria;I don’t even know... there were just so many tools I didn't know how to use, and there was just dirt everywhere, and the carrots…;6;L
Sunny;Was picking carrots really that bad?;6;R
Maria;No... Well... I don’t know. It shouldn’t have been.;0;L
Maria;But there was just so much of it. And you know what made it worse?;6;L
Maria;All of them had these little things growing out of them, and they were all stuck to the soil and -;6;L
Maria;I fell over trying to get the goddamn thing out of the ground and my hair got all messed up and the dirt got inside my overalls and...;6;L
Sunny;...;6;R
Maria;... Sorry;3;L
Sunny;No, it’s okay. I was just worried that you might break a glass and hurt yourself.;6;R
Maria;What? Me? Hurt myself? I’d never...;3;L
Sunny;You just said that you fell over trying to pull a carrot out of the ground.;6;R
Maria;What? That was just a... I didn’t mean...;3;L
Maria;(She hates me.);4;L
Sunny;Don't Worry, I’m just messing with you.;5;R
Maria;Oh, ahha ha ha… you got me…;5;L
Sunny;But hey, I’m sorry you’re not liking it here so far. I do hope that our little town has something to offer other than the pain of harvesting carrots.;0;R
Maria;Well, the sheep are really cute.;1;L
Maria;...Probably. I still haven't seen one.;6;L
Maria;And the fact that I get to talk to a cute girl makes this entire day worth it.;2;L
Sunny;...;9;R
Maria;(Good job, María, good job.);4;L
Sunny;Well, uh… thank you.;1;R
Sunny;So... uh... um... tell me more about yourself, María.;0;R
