Maria;(Okay, just gonna quietly sneak into the house, and just...);9;L
Rosa;Mar√≠a!;2;R
Maria;Agh!!!;14;L
Maria;Abuela! How?! What!? Why are you up this late?;14;L
Rosa;I was worried! I thought you said you knew your limits!;2;R
Maria;What???? I knew my limits...;4;L
Rosa;Where have you been!;2;R
Maria;Uhhh, the bar?;4;L
Rosa;The bar? For six hours!?!?!?;2;R
Maria;...;4;L
Maria;Yes...?;4;L
Rosa;How?;2;R
Maria;Well, I got to the bar, Barnabus was there, and I was like, "Wow, it's Barnabus!"...;1;L
Maria;And then I drank a bourbon and it didn't go so hot, and then I saw this girl sitting in the corner...;1;L
Maria;And I was like, "Wah, she's so cute!";2;L

Maria;Like, she has a lot on her plate, being a teacher and all.;9;L

Maria;Maybe even TOO deep...;9;L

Maria;Yeah, exactly as I planned. Because I knew my limits. Yup.;1;L
