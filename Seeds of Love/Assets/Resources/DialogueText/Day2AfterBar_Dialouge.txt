Maria;(That was so fun!);1;L
Maria;(I'm not the best dancer, but hopefully she picked something up from my moves.);1;L
Sunny;Thank you for that dance, María. It's been a while since I did something like that.;12;R
Maria;Really?;0;L
Sunny;Well, the only dances I go to are for kids...;12;R
Sunny;And no one wants to see their boring teacher bust a move.;12;R
Maria;Well, they're missing out! You were great.;1;L
Sunny;Thanks. Maybe we should show them together next time.;12;R

Maria;Oh yeah... That was supposed to be part of a pick-up line.;2;L
Maria;I wasn't in the best mood, so it ended up falling pretty flat...;2;L
Sunny;Yeah, I figured. It was cute, though.;1;R
Maria;Really? Wasn't it weird?;5;L
Sunny;Well, a little bit. But still, mostly cute.;0;R
Maria;(My weird outburst was cute... Huh...);5;L

Maria;Meeting you was probably one of the best things that's happened to me since I left college.;1;L
Sunny;Oh it was?;0;R

Sunny;...;3;R
Sunny;Thanks. You know, you're pretty cute too.;1;R

Sunny;Even when my life, my job, my family... Even when when I'm stressed out, I can look forward to seeing you.;0;R
Sunny;To talking to you, to ranting and venting and laughing at your jokes...;0;R
Sunny;I'll miss that. I'll miss you if you go, María.;11;R

Maria;Don't worry, I kinda need to stay here.;1;L
