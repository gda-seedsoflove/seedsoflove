Maria;(AHHHH!!!);4;L
Maria;(That was so bad!);4;L
Maria;(I kept stepping on her feet... And falling...);4;L
Maria;(I don't know how I thought I'd be good at this.);12;L
Sunny;María, are you okay?;0;R
Sunny;Maybe it wasn't the best idea to try dancing right after you'd been working all day...;6;R
Maria;You're right... To be honest, I had a pretty tough time at the farm today.;15;L
Maria;My abuela's friend wanted to go out with her today, and I told her I could plow the field by myself.;15;L

Maria;I somehow managed to get it all done by hand, but it was exhausting.;15;L
Sunny;Wait, you plowed a whole field by hand in one day?!;4;R
Maria;Uh, yeah.;0;L
Maria;I didn't know how to turn the tractor on, so...;2;L
Sunny;That's amazing!;4;R

Maria;I tried to get it all done by hand, but I ended up making a mess.;15;L
Sunny;Wait, you tried to plow a whole field by hand?!;4;R
Maria;I didn't know how to turn the tractor on, so...;2;L
Sunny;Even if you didn't get it all done, that's amazing!;4;R
Sunny;You should probably just call your grandma next time, though.;0;R
Maria;(Tell me about it.);15;L

Sunny;Still, I'm surprised you still wanted to come to the bar tonight after all that.;6;R
Sunny;If I were you, I'd just want to sleep...;6;R
Maria;Well, I promised I'd meet you tonight.;0;L
Maria;I'm not sure how much longer I can stay here, so I don't want to miss out on seeing you.;0;L
Maria;(That was too honest!);5;L
Sunny;María, it's important to take care of yourself.;6;R
Sunny;But, I, um...;0;R
Sunny;It makes me really happy to know you like hanging out with me that much.;9;R
Maria;(!!!);4;L
Sunny;And I... I don't really want you to leave, either.;11;R
Maria;(!!!!!!!);4;L
Maria;I - I wouldn't worry about that too much!;2;L
Sunny;Oh, really?;3;R
Maria;Well, my abuela still needs to teach me how to turn on a tractor.;1;L
Maria;And if you don't mind, I think need help with my dancing too...;2;L
Sunny;Of course I don't mind! I'm a teacher, after all.;1;R
Sunny;Well, student teacher.;9;R
Maria;Good enough for me!;2;L
Maria;(I'm glad she's so understanding. It almost makes me want to...);2;L
Player;Hug her!:line,49,D2GoodBar1,D2GoodBar11;KISS HER.:line,45,D2GoodBar1,D2GoodBar12
Maria;(Wait, kiss her?! Kiss her?????);3;L
Maria;(I... want to kiss her.);5;L
Maria;(I'm not sure if this is the right time for that, though.);4;L
Maria;(Keep it together, María. Go in for a hug. Deal with kissy thoughts later.);11;L
Maria;Thank you so much for today, Sunny.;1;L
Maria;Is it okay if I hug you?;2;L
Sunny;Oh! Y-yeah! Of course!;3;R
Maria;Then I'll just -;2;L
Maria;WOOPS;14;L
