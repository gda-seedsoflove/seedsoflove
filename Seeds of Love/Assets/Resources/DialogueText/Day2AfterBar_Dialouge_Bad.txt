Sunny;Well, that was an interesting experience.;0;R
Sunny;It wasn't bad though.;1;R
Maria;It-It wasn't?;3;L
Suny;No, I've had worse. Plus it was really fun to fail at dancing.;1;R
Maria;We literally ended up on the ground so many times though. How is that not a problem for you?;4;L
Maria;(I planned out this whole situation to dance with her and it couldn't have gone any worse.);4;L
Sunny;It's okay. Maybe if you're in town any longer, I can give you some dancing lessons.;5;R
Maria;R-Really?;5;L
Sunny;Yeah. It's not the first time I've taught someone to dance.;1;R
Maria;So you're a teacher of many things.;2;R
Sunny;Yeah. I guess so.;0;R
Sunny;So, are you interested?;12;R
Maria;Sure, I guess.;5;L
