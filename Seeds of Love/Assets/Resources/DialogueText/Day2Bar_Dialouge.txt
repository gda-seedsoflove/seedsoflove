##;Rosa;exit
Maria;(Excellent. The plan is unfolding quite nicely.);9;L
Sunny;...Hi Maria.;0;R
Maria;Oh hey Sunny! How was your day?;1;L

Sunny;Hey, so why did you call me over today?;0;R
Maria;Oh, uhhhh... talking to you last night was amazing, and I couldn't wait to see you again.;2;L
Sunny;Aww, that's sweet. Hey, is that your abūela?;3;R

Barnabus;Here's your drink.;0;R
Rosa;Thanks.;0;L
Rosa;What's with the lemon wedge?;3;L
Barnabus;Oh, sorry. Your granddaughter always gets it with a lemon wedge. Haven't done it any other way for a month now.;0;R
Rosa;Oh. That's... interesting...;3;L
Rosa;Let me just take this wedge out...;3;L
##;Barnabus;exit
Maria;Abuela!;9;R
Rosa;!!! Huh?;0;L
Rosa;Oh, yes mija?;0;L
Maria;I want you to meet someone! This is Sunny! She's a big fan.;1;R
##;Maria;exit
Sunny;Hi...;0;R

##;Sunny;exit
Maria;Well, how about you guys talk for a bit while I get a drink from Barnabus?;9;R

Sunny;Oh, uh, sure, I -;4;R
##;Sunny;exit
Maria;Great!;1;R
Maria;(Hehehe, all according to plan.);2;R
##;Maria;exit
Sunny;Um...;2;R
Rosa;María says you're a big fan?;0;L
Sunny;Uhhh, I don't know where she got that!;9;R
Sunny;I mean I like what you do!;12;R
Sunny;But not like where I'd follow your every move...;9;R
Sunny;That sounded super creepy...;12;R
Sunny;I'm sorry, I'm not usually like this.;9;R
Rosa;Right...;0;L
Rosa;So, how did you get to know my granddaughter?;0;L
Sunny;Oh! Interestingly enough, we met right here!;3;R

##;Scene;header:D2BarS11
Sunny;I remember her walking in, brimming with confidence.;0;R
Sunny;She ordered a bourbon, and proceeded to choke on it.;1;R
Sunny;That didn't seem to stop her though, so after Barnabus gave her a glass of milk, she came over, and...;1;R
Sunny;... Maybe this was a joke... but she said the funniest pick-up line.;5;R
##;Scene;choice:D1BarC1
##;Scene;header:D1GoodBarD1
Sunny;She said if I was a vegetable, I must be a cutecumber.;9;R
##;Scene;jumpToHeader:D2BarS1C
##;Scene;header:D1GoodBarD2
Sunny;She said she died on the bourbon, and I was the angel in heaven.;9;R
##;Scene;jumpToHeader:D2BarS1C
##;Scene;header:D2BarS12
Sunny;I remember she walked in really sad and covered in dirt.;0;R
Sunny;I guess Barnabus must have noticed how bad she felt, so he gave María a drink on the house.;0;R
Sunny;She ended up choking on it though...;6;R
Sunny;She was a new person in the bar, and I felt bad, so I came over to see if she was alright.;0;R
##;Scene;choice:D1BarC1
##;Scene;header:D1BadBarD1
Sunny;I don't know what was going on in her head, but when I said hi to her, she called me a cutecumber.;1;R

Sunny;I don't know what was going on in her head, but when I said hi to her, she called me a bourbon angel.;1;R
##;Scene;jumpToHeader:D2BarS1C
##;Scene;header:D2BarS1C
Rosa;Quite a conversation starter.;1;L
Sunny;I know right? I was trying so hard not to laugh.;1;R
Sunny;Anyways, after that whole thing, we just started talking to each other about stuff.;0;R
Sunny;She told me why she decided to come here.;0;R
##;Scene;moodJump:AfterBar:0.5:D2BarS11:D2BarS12
##;Scene;header:D2BarS11
Sunny;Then I accidentally went into a full on rant about my students.;1;R
Sunny;But she listened to the entire thing, which is why I really like her...;0;R
##;Scene;jumpToHeader:D2BarS2C
##;Scene;header:D2BarS12
Sunny;I asked her more about herself, and she went into this whole rant about how her college life didn't work out for her...;0;R
Sunny;And how she made the leap to come work at your farm.;0;R
Sunny;I felt like I really connected with her then, and I ended up really liking her...;0;R
##;Scene;jumpToHeader:D2BarS2C
##;Scene;header:D2BarS2C
Rosa;Oh, are the two of you...?;1;L
Sunny;What? Oh, uhhh..., no...;3;R
Sunny;I didn't mean that I like her like that...;3;R
Sunny;She's just been a really great... friend...;3;R
Rosa;Uh huh...;0;L
##;Rosa;exit
Maria;Hey, how are you guys?;9;L
Sunny;Maria! Hey... hi... Oh, yeah... no... it's been great talking to your grandma.;4;R
##;Maria;exit
Rosa;Yes, I got to learn a lot more about you.;0;L
##;Rosa;exit
Maria;Oh that's cool.;9;L
Maria;Wait, what'd you tell her?;0;L
Sunny;Nothing! Just telling her about the first time we met...;4;R
Maria;Oh, right... that was quite a day...;2;L
Maria;(Great, now Rosa knows...);5;L
##;Maria;exit
Rosa;I'll leave you two kids to your talk. Remember María, we're leaving at ten.;0;L
##;Rosa;exit
Maria;Yes, Abuela.;0;L
Sunny;Wow, your grandma gave you a curfew?;0;R
Maria;Yeah... she wanted to make sure I stopped coming home at four in the morning.;2;L
Sunny;Oh... yeah, I guess our late nights are starting to get later and later.;5;R
Maria;I don't mind, it just means I get to spend more time with you.;2;L
Sunny;...;3;R
Sunny;I feel the same way...;2;R
Maria;(She feels the same way?);5;L
Sunny;...;5;R
Maria;...;5;L
Maria;Hey Sunny?;0;L
Sunny;Yeah?;3;R
Maria;May I have this dance?;9;L
Sunny;...;3;R
Sunny;How can I say no?;1;R
