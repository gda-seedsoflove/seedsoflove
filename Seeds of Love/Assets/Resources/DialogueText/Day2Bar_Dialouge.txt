Sunny;I remember her walking in, brimming with confidence.;0;R
Sunny;She ordered a bourbon, and proceeded to choke on it.;1;R
Sunny;That didn't seem to stop her though, so after Barnabus gave her a glass of milk, she came over, and...;1;R
Sunny;... Maybe this was a joke... but she said the funniest pick-up line.;5;R
