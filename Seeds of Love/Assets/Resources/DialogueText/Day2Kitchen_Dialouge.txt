Maria;Ahh, I'm coming, I'm coming.;0;L
Rosa;...;0;R
Maria;I'm up, and here, and... yaaaaawn... yeah.;0;L
Rosa;I thought after a month of working here that you would start waking up in the morning without me having to call you.
Maria;I’m sorry. It’s just that last night, it was just...;0;L
Rosa;And what’s with you going out every weekend? Don’t you ever get tired of that?;0;R
Maria;No... I don't think so.;1;L
Maria;(Not as long as I get to see Sunny again.);2;L
Rosa;Maria!;2;R
Maria;Yes!;0;L
Rosa;Honestly, I think these late nights are getting to you.;3;R
Maria;What? No... I think I'm doing great!;1;L
Rosa;I'm talking to you, and you're barely paying attention.;3;R
Player;Sorry, this is just me. I never woke up before 7am in college.:line,17,D2KitchenC1,D2KitchenC1-1;Sorry I was daydreaming about somebody.:line,17,D2KitchenC1,D2KitchenC1-2
Rosa;I don't care.
Maria;(Oh...)
Rosa;María...;as farmers, we need to trust each other that we can all get our work done.
Rosa;So far, you've been handling it, but I'm worried that you'll lose interest and just quit.
Maria;(Wait, did she just call me a farmer?)
Maria;(Am I a real farmer now?)
Rosa;I... hold on. Let me get the phone.
Rosa;Hello?
Rosa;Oh Donna! Hi!
Maria;(Donna?)
Rosa;Oh it's been great!
Rosa;Yeah everything's very good.
Rosa;Yeah, the farm is great! In fact my granddaughter is helping out over here as well!
Maria;(Aww... she's talking about me!)
Rosa;What? Was that today?
Rosa;I can't I'm alone on the farm today.
Rosa;No, Barnabus is working in the post office today.
Rosa;What, María? No... She can't handle the farm by herself.
Maria;Wait what?
Rosa;She's only been here for a month. I could never ask her to do that.
Maria;Wait, I could do it.
Rosa;What? No, hold on Donna... What'd you just say, María?
Maria;I can take care of the farm. You go do that thing you were going to do.
Rosa;Are you... No, hold on Donna, I'm asking her!
Rosa;Are you sure?
Maria;Yes!
Maria;See, you go do whatever you have to do, and I can show you that you can trust me to handle the farm.
Rosa;Okay, let me... Yes Donna, she said yes... Yes... Yes, we'll meet there. Okay... Bye!
Rosa;María.
Maria;Yes?
Rosa;Do you know what to do today?
Maria;Yes?...
Rosa;Since you sound unsure, let's go over it.
Rosa;Most of the spring harvest is over so all you have to do is...
Maria;(Wow, abuela thinks I'm a real farmer now.)
Maria;(She's going to trust me with the whole farm. I can't let her down.)
Maria;(I'm going to show her that when I say I can do something, I can do it.)
Maria;(I'm going to do an amazing job on the farm today!)
Maria;(And abuela is going to be like "Oh my, María! You're so good at this!")
Maria;(And I'll be like "Yeah, I'm amazing" and we'll go to the bar to meet Sunny...)
Maria;(And then abuela will tell Sunny about all the amazing things I do on the farm...)
Maria;(And then BArnabus will start playing that son I told him to!)
Maria;(Then Sunny and I will dance and it'll be great!)
Rosa;... Once you're done with all those things, drive the tractor back into the shed and leave it parked there.
Rosa;You got all that, María?
Maria;Huh, oh! Yeah! I totally got it!
Rosa;Great! The keys are on the counter. I've got to go.
Rosa;Good Luck!
##;Rosa;exit
Maria;Okay... Don't worry abuela, I've got this...
