Sunny;I got a little frustrated because she’s usually such a sweetheart, and.. Oh, um, I’m rambling, aren't I? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to.;11;R
Maria;No-no, it’s okay!;0;L
Sunny;Look at me, dumping all my problems on someone I just met. Sorry again.;11;R
Maria;Seriously, it’s okay! I don’t mind at all. It was obvious you needed to someone to talk to.;0;L
Sunny;...;5;R
Maria;And you shouldn’t have to deal with all that on your own.;6;L
Sunny;... Thank you.;0;R
Maria;Besides, it was fun getting to know you. I don't think I've ever really talked to anyone like this before.;2;L
Sunny;...;9;R
Maria;(So cheesy... but it's the truth.);2;L
Sunny;Um, this is a bit random, but...;0;R
Maria;Yeah?;0;L
Sunny;What time is it?;3;R
Maria;Oh. Uh, around midnight.;0;L
Sunny;That’s... pretty late. Sorry, I should head home soon.;3;R
Maria;Sorry for keeping you so long!;0;L
Sunny;I would stay longer! If I could. I’ve stayed longer tonight than I ever have.;0;R
Sunny;And, about what you said...;0;R

Sunny;Pfft..! It’s Friday, María. Well, Saturday now.;1;R
Maria;Oh, right!;5;L
Sunny;But seriously, thank you for talking to me tonight. Going up to people is hard, so I usually sit alone.;0;R
Sunny;This was really nice.;1;R
Maria;Hey, thanks for talking to me too. I'm glad my lame pick-up line didn't scare you off.;1;L
Sunny;Don’t say that! I thought it was cute.;0;R
