Maria;(Whew... I knew it was a good idea to come to the farm! Picking carrots was a piece of carrot cake!);1;L
Maria;(Oof, that was a bad pun.);3;L
Maria;(Oh, there’s my abuela.);0;L
Rosa;How was your first day, mija?;0;R
Maria;Oh, hey abuelita! It was so great today! The rhythm of farming felt so natural!;1;L
Maria;(Oh, that pun wasn't any better.);3;L
Rosa;I do have to admit you picked this up rather quickly. Not bad, for your first day.;1;R
Maria;Right! I’m so good at this! I can’t wait for tomorrow!;1;L
Rosa;Well, why wait? Now that the fields are clear, there’s nothing stopping you from plowing them again.;1;R
Rosa;If you go now, you might be able to finish by sunrise.;1;R
Maria;H-huh?;0;L
Rosa;Oh! And since you’re such a natural, why don’t you plant the pumpkin seeds too! I’m sure you can get it all done overnight.;1;R
Maria;W-wait! What!?;14;L
Rosa;I’m kidding! I wouldn’t want to overwork you after only one day!;1;R
Maria;Oh... haha...;2;L
Rosa;Alright, enough messing around. Let’s go inside. You must be tired after such a long day.;0;R
Maria;Actually, I was thinking that I would go out tonight. It’s my first day here, so I’m excited to see the town!;9;L
Rosa;Yes, and while we're doing that, why don't we tip some cows too.;1;R
Maria;Can we?;0;L
Rosa;No, now come on, let's go inside.;0;R
Maria;So, I can't go out?;0;L
Rosa;Oh, you were serious.;0;R
Rosa;María, I don’t know what you usually get up to at night, but if you’re trying to be a farmer, you really should get some sleep.;0;R
Rosa;We’re going to have to work even harder tomorrow, and that means waking up early too.;0;R
Maria;Aw, don’t worry about it! I can work just fine without much sleep.;1;L
Maria;College, you know.;2;L
Rosa;This is not college, María. This is a farm, and you need to be awake early tomorrow.;2;R
Rosa;And I am not just saying this as your abuela.;2;R
Rosa;Working on a farm means having responsibilities, and I think you’ll want to rest.;0;R
Maria;I know you’re worried about me, but I still want to go out tonight. I know my limits, and I’ll be back when I get tired.;6;L
Maria;See ya later!;1;L
Rosa;María, wait...!;4;R
