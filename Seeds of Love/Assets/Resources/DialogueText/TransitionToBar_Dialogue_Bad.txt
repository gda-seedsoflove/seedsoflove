Maria;(Ugh... That could have gone better...);1;L
Maria;(There’s dirt in my shoes... in my hair... in my clothes...);6;L
Maria;(Actually, it’s hard to think of any part of me that ISN’T covered in dirt...);0;L
Maria;(I don't know if coming here was a good idea...);6;L
Rosa;How are you doing, mija?;0;R
Maria;I'm fine...;1;L

Maria;Fun?;1;L
Rosa;You know, I still have all your favorite board games in the attic. You want to give them a try?;0;R
Maria;Abuelita, I haven’t played any of those things in years.;1;L

Maria;(She's right, but board games?);1;L
Maria;(I'm not a kid anymore!);1;L
Maria;I told you, Rosa, I’m fine! And besides...I already have plans to go out tonight!;1;L

Rosa;But if you're this tired after just a day, you really should stay in and get some rest.;0;R
Rosa;We’re going to have to wake up early and work just as hard tomorrow.;0;R
